  You are an expert in JavaScript, Typescript, React, Node.js, Next.js App Router, Zustand, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Tailwind, and Stylus.

I've reviewed your GitHub repo for gbot_v01, and I'll create a set of cursor rules tailored to this project, taking into account your implementation of Zustand for state management.

# gbot_v01 Cursor Rules

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, maintainable React and TypeScript code
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces for prop typing
- Follow component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use descriptive variable names that indicate purpose (e.g., `isGenerating`, `processedSvgs`)

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for React components: `GraffitiDisplay`, `CustomizationToolbar`
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and interfaces: `customizationOptions`, `handleInputTextChange`
- Use descriptive names for SVG-related utilities: `findOptimalOverlap`, `processSvg`

## Component Structure

- Organize components hierarchically in the `src/components` directory
- Split complex components into smaller subcomponents for better maintainability
- Use index files to export components from directories

## State Management with Zustand

- Use Zustand for global state management
- Create separate stores for different domains (e.g., `useGraffitiStore`, `useCustomizationStore`)
- Define clear actions and selectors in store files
- Keep store structure flat and avoid deeply nested state objects
- Use middleware like `immer` for easier state updates when needed

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Define comprehensive interfaces in `src/types.ts`
- Use proper typing for all functions and components
- Leverage TypeScript's type system for SVG processing functions
- Implement union types for state fields with limited options
- Use type guards to handle conditional logic based on types

## SVG Processing and Rendering

- Optimize SVG processing with caching strategies
- Implement efficient algorithms for calculating letter positioning
- Use memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders of SVG components
- Handle SVG customization through dedicated utility functions
- Implement proper error handling for SVG fetching and processing

## Performance Optimization

- Use React.memo for components that don't need frequent re-renders
- Implement useMemo and useCallback hooks for expensive calculations
- Use proper dependency arrays in hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize SVG rendering pipeline for better performance
- Implement efficient caching mechanisms for processed SVGs

## Error Handling

- Implement proper error boundaries for SVG rendering components
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations like SVG fetching
- Display user-friendly error messages when operations fail
- Log detailed error information for debugging purposes
- Use fallback mechanisms when letter SVGs aren't available

## UI and Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for responsive layouts and component styling
- Follow a consistent color scheme throughout the application
- Implement responsive design principles for different screen sizes
- Use consistent spacing and padding values
- Ensure good contrast ratios for accessibility

## Project-Specific Conventions

- Use custom hooks for shared logic (e.g., `useSvgCache`, `useGraffitiGenerator`)
- Implement history stack for undo/redo functionality
- Organize SVG-related utilities in dedicated utility files
- Follow consistent patterns for customization options

## Testing

- Write unit tests for SVG processing utilities
- Implement component tests for UI components
- Test SVG rendering with different customization options
- Ensure proper error handling in edge cases
