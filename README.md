- **Optimized Fallbacks**: Styled placeholders for missing letters
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal overhead with conditional compilation

### Bundle Optimization Architecture
**Tree-Shaking Optimizations:**
- **Radix UI**: Specific imports instead of wildcard imports for all components
- **Icon Library**: Tree-shakeable Lucide React with individual icon imports
- **Development Tools**: Lazy-loaded with `React.Suspense` for production exclusion
- **Component Memoization**: Strategic `React.memo()` for expensive renders

**Build Configuration:**
- **Aggressive tree-shaking**: `moduleSideEffects: false` for maximum optimization
- **Strategic chunking**: Optimal cache efficiency with manual chunk splitting
- **Production cleanup**: Console log stripping and development code elimination
- **Bundle analysis**: On-demand visualization with `npm run analyze`

### Development Workflows

**Bundle Analysis (New):**
- Use `npm run analyze` to generate interactive bundle composition reports
- Monitor chunk sizes and dependency contributions with treemap visualization
- Track optimization progress with before/after size comparisons
- Identify optimization opportunities with gzip/brotli analysis

**Overlap Generation (Required for consistent positioning):**
- Use Overlap Debug Panel to generate complete 36Ã—36 character matrix
- Export 1,296 letter pair combinations using runtime pixel-based calculations
- Auto-update `src/data/generatedOverlapLookup.ts` as single source of truth
- Both processing modes reference this file for consistent letter positioning

**SVG Artwork Management (Required when adding new letters):**
- Use SVG Processing Panel to generate lookup tables for new artwork
- Process all letter variants (standard, alternate, first, last) and bounds
- Export complete SVG data files for production integration
- Validate generated lookup tables for accuracy and performance

### Key Performance Metrics
- **Letter Processing**: ~0.1-1ms per letter in production (vs 50-100ms runtime)
- **Total Generation**: <10ms for typical phrases (vs 500-1000ms+ runtime)
- **Bundle Size**: ~760KB optimized (vs ~799KB pre-optimization)
- **Dependencies**: 31 packages (vs 52 pre-optimization)
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized data structures with conditional loading
- **Build Optimization**: Unused development code excluded from production bundles
