## Performance Architecture

### Hybrid SVG Processing System
The application uses a sophisticated dual-mode system optimized for both development and production:

**Development Mode:**
- **Full Runtime Processing**: Complete `processSvg()` functionality for flexibility
- **Lookup Tables**: Pre-computed lookup tables for supported letters  
- **Development Tools**: SVG Processing Panel, Overlap Debug Panel, Performance Testing
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed timing and method detection for optimization
- **Debug Console**: Verbose logging for development analysis

**Production Mode:**
- **Pure Lookup Processing**: Only lookup table retrieval for maximum performance
- **Clean Builds**: Zero development noise, preloading, or verbose logging
- **Optimized Fallbacks**: Styled placeholders for missing letters
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal overhead with conditional compilation

### Development Workflows

**Overlap Generation (Required for consistent positioning):**
- Use Overlap Debug Panel to generate complete 36Ã—36 character matrix
- Export 1,296 letter pair combinations using runtime pixel-based calculations
- Auto-update `src/data/generatedOverlapLookup.ts` as single source of truth
- Both processing modes reference this file for consistent letter positioning

**SVG Artwork Management (Required when adding new letters):**
- Use SVG Processing Panel to generate lookup tables for new artwork
- Process all letter variants (standard, alternate, first, last) and bounds
- Export complete SVG data files for production integration
- Validate generated lookup tables for accuracy and performance

### Key Performance Metrics
- **Letter Processing**: ~0.1-1ms per letter in production (vs 50-100ms runtime)
- **Total Generation**: <10ms for typical phrases (vs 500-1000ms+ runtime)
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized data structures with conditional loading
- **Build Optimization**: Unused development code excluded from production bundles

- Google OAuth integration
- Session management and persistence
- Comprehensive security measures

Authentication is implemented through dedicated components and hooks:
- Custom hooks for email verification and modal state management
- Reusable UI components for auth flows
- Centralized state management with Zustand

For comprehensive details on the authentication system, see [Authentication Documentation](./docs/AUTHENTICATION.md).
