# Development Workflows Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the essential workflows for developing and maintaining the Stizack graffiti generation application, including SVG artwork management, overlap generation, and the hybrid development/production system.

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Overview

### Hybrid Processing System
The application operates in two distinct modes:

**Development Mode (`npm run dev`)**:
- Full runtime SVG processing capabilities
- Pre-computed lookup tables for supported letters
- Development tools and performance tracking
- Verbose logging and debug console output
- Preloading and predictive caching

**Production Mode (`npm run build`)**:
- Pure lookup-based processing only
- Clean console with zero development noise
- Optimized performance with styled fallbacks
- Conditional compilation excludes development code

### Build Flags
```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  define: {
    __DEV_SVG_PROCESSING__: isDev,
    __PROD_LOOKUP_ONLY__: !isDev,
  }
});
```

## üé® SVG Artwork Management Workflow

### When to Use
- Adding new letter styles to the application
- Creating lookup tables for new graffiti fonts
- Updating existing letter artwork that affects bounds or processing

### Process Overview

#### Step 1: Prepare SVG Assets
1. **File Organization**: Place new letter SVGs in appropriate asset directories
   ```
   public/assets/letters/[style-name]/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ a.svg, b.svg, c.svg ... z.svg, 0.svg ... 9.svg
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alternates/ (optional)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ first/ (optional)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ last/ (optional)
   ```

2. **SVG Requirements**:
   - Consistent viewBox dimensions (typically 200x200)
   - Clean, optimized SVG markup
   - Proper letter bounds and positioning
   - Compatible with existing style patterns

#### Step 2: Access SVG Processing Panel
1. **Location**: Development mode only - available in app development tools
2. **Requirements**: Application must be running in development mode
3. **Access**: Navigate to development panels section

#### Step 3: Generate Lookup Tables
1. **Configure Processing**:
   - Select target style for processing
   - Choose variants to include (standard, alternate, first, last)
   - Set processing options and resolution

2. **Process Letters**:
   - Process all letters and variants for the style
   - Generate complete SVG data including bounds, content, and metadata
   - Calculate processing times and optimization metrics

3. **Export Results**:
   - Generate lookup table file with complete SVG data
   - Export TypeScript file for production integration
   - Include metadata for validation and debugging

#### Step 4: File Integration
1. **Save Generated Files**:
   - Save lookup table file to `src/data/generated/`
   - Update main data index if needed
   - Ensure proper TypeScript exports

2. **Validation**:
   - Test generated lookup tables for accuracy
   - Verify all letters and variants are included
   - Check processing performance improvements

### Generated File Structure
```typescript
// Example: src/data/generated/svg-lookup-[style].ts
export interface ProcessedSvgData {
  letter: string;
  style: string;
  variant: 'standard' | 'alternate' | 'first' | 'last';
  bounds: { left: number; right: number; top: number; bottom: number };
  width: number;
  height: number;
  viewBox: string;
  svgContent: string;
  metadata: {
    hasContent: boolean;
    isSymmetric: boolean;
    processingTime: number;
    fileSize: number;
    optimized: boolean;
  };
}

export const SVG_LOOKUP_[STYLE]: Record<string, ProcessedSvgData[]> = {
  // Complete lookup data for all letters
};
```

## üîÑ Overlap Generation Workflow

### Single Source of Truth Concept
The file `src/data/generatedOverlapLookup.ts` serves as the **central authority** for all overlap calculations. Both LOOKUP and RUNTIME processing modes reference this file for consistent letter positioning.

### Complete Overlap Generation (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Access Overlap Debug Panel
1. **Location**: Development mode only - bottom-right corner of application
2. **Requirements**: Application running in development mode
3. **Purpose**: Generate production-ready overlap values

#### Step 2: Generate Complete Matrix
1. **Action**: Click "Export Lookup Table" in the debug panel
2. **Processing**: 
   - Calculates overlap values for all 1,296 letter pair combinations
   - Uses runtime pixel-based calculation algorithms
   - Covers complete alphanumeric set (a-z, 0-9)
   - Processes each combination individually for maximum precision

3. **Time Requirements**: 1-3 minutes depending on system performance
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicator during generation

#### Step 3: Export and Update
1. **Export Results**: Complete TypeScript code for lookup table
2. **File Update**: Click "Update File" to save to `src/data/generatedOverlapLookup.ts`
3. **Apply Changes**: Refresh application to load new overlap values
4. **Validation**: Test graffiti generation with various text combinations

### Individual Letter Testing (Optional)

#### For Quick Testing and Fine-tuning
1. **Select Letter**: Choose letter from dropdown menu
2. **Adjust Values**:
   - Min Overlap: 0.01 to 0.5 range
   - Max Overlap: 0.01 to 0.5 range
   - Special Cases: Custom overlap for specific letter pairs

3. **Visual Feedback**: Modified letters marked with (‚Ä¢) indicator
4. **Testing**: Changes applied immediately for real-time preview
5. **Reset**: Restore to lookup table values as needed

### Generated File Structure
```typescript
// src/data/generatedOverlapLookup.ts (auto-generated)
export const COMPLETE_OVERLAP_LOOKUP: Record<string, Record<string, number>> = {
  'a': {
    'a': 0.12, 'b': 0.08, 'c': 0.15, // ... all combinations
  },
  'b': {
    'a': 0.10, 'b': 0.12, 'c': 0.14, // ... all combinations
  },
  // ... complete 36x36 character matrix
};

export const getOverlapValue = (
  firstChar: string, 
  secondChar: string, 
  fallback: number = 0.12
): number => {
  return COMPLETE_OVERLAP_LOOKUP[firstChar]?.[secondChar] ?? fallback;
};
```

## üöÄ Performance Testing & Validation

### Available Testing Tools

#### LookupIntegrationTest Component
- **Purpose**: Validates lookup system accuracy against runtime processing
- **Location**: Development mode testing panel
- **Usage**: Compare results between lookup and runtime for consistency

#### LookupPerformanceTest Component
- **Purpose**: Measures and compares processing speeds
- **Metrics**: Processing times, method detection, performance ratios
- **Usage**: Benchmark optimizations and identify bottlenecks

#### Performance Monitoring
- **Real-time Tracking**: Timing analysis during graffiti generation
- **Method Detection**: Identifies whether lookup or runtime processing was used
- **Development Only**: Tracking disabled in production builds

### Testing Workflows

#### Before Adding New Artwork
1. Baseline current performance with existing letters
2. Note any problematic letter combinations
3. Document current overlap values for comparison

#### After Adding New Artwork
1. Run SVG Processing Panel to generate lookup tables
2. Use LookupPerformanceTest to verify performance improvements
3. Generate new overlap matrix with Overlap Debug Panel
4. Validate positioning quality with various text combinations
5. Compare performance metrics with baseline

#### Production Validation
1. Build production version locally (`npm run build && npm run preview`)
2. Test graffiti generation performance
3. Verify clean console output (no development noise)
4. Validate fallback behavior for missing letters
5. Check overall user experience

## üîß Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Maintenance

#### Weekly
- Review any new SVG artwork submissions
- Test overlap generation with different text combinations
- Monitor performance metrics and user feedback

#### Monthly
- Audit generated lookup table file sizes
- Review and optimize SVG assets for better compression
- Update documentation based on workflow improvements

#### As Needed
- Regenerate overlap values after significant artwork changes
- Update lookup tables when adding new letter styles
- Optimize performance based on usage analytics

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Overlap Generation Issues
- **Problem**: Export taking too long
- **Solution**: Check system performance, consider processing in smaller batches

- **Problem**: Inconsistent positioning
- **Solution**: Regenerate complete overlap matrix, verify artwork bounds

#### SVG Processing Issues
- **Problem**: Letters not appearing in lookup tables
- **Solution**: Verify SVG file paths and naming conventions

- **Problem**: Performance regression
- **Solution**: Check for runtime processing fallbacks, validate lookup coverage

#### Build Issues
- **Problem**: Production build fails
- **Solution**: Verify build flags are properly configured, check TypeScript types
