- **Language**: TypeScript 5.5.3
- **State Management**: Zustand 5.0.3
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.1
- **UI Components**: 
  - Radix UI primitives
  - Custom components
- **Animation**: Framer Motion 12.5.0

## Core Features

### SVG Processing and Rendering
The application implements sophisticated SVG processing with features including:
- Vector-based artwork processing for high-quality output
- Intelligent letter positioning with pixel-density-based overlap
- Automatic rotation rules for specific letter combinations
- Bounds detection and optimization for layout
- Efficient caching mechanisms for processed SVGs

### Letter Positioning System
- Utilizes pixel data analysis for optimal letter overlap
- Implements special case handling for specific letter pairs
- Density-based positioning for authentic graffiti appearance
- Vertical pixel range analysis for efficient overlap calculation
- Customizable overlap rules for fine-tuning

### Customization Features
All implemented effects include:
- **Background**: Custom background colors and toggles
- **Fill**: Color customization for letter fills
- **Stroke**: Width and color customization for outlines
- **Shadow**: Multi-parameter shadow effects with opacity and blur
- **Stamp**: Custom width and color effects
- **Shield**: Protective outline effect with width and color options
- **Shadow Effect**: Offset controls for depth
- **Shine**: (Implementation ready but currently unused)

### State Management
The application uses Zustand for efficient state management with:
- Centralized state store for all customization options
- History tracking for undo/redo functionality
- Efficient SVG caching and processing state
- Real-time preview updates
- Preset management system

## Component Architecture

### UI Components
The application uses a comprehensive UI system built with:
- Radix UI primitives for accessibility and interaction
- Custom components with Tailwind styling
- Framer Motion for animations

### Core Components

#### GraffitiDisplay
- Handles SVG composition and rendering
- Manages layout and positioning
- Implements efficient update mechanisms
- Provides real-time preview capabilities

#### CustomizationToolbar
- Provides comprehensive customization controls
- Implements customization sliders and toggles
- Offers real-time preview updates
- Groups related controls logically

#### StylePresetsPanel
- Manages preset style selection and application
- Handles user-created preset management
- Provides preset saving, loading, and deletion
- Organizes presets in an easy-to-browse grid layout

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Implement proper type definitions
- Follow component-based architecture
- Keep components focused and maintainable
- Extract complex functionality into separate components
- Limit component size to improve maintainability

### Performance Optimization
- Implement SVG caching mechanisms
- Use pixel-based density calculations
- Optimize overlap calculations
- Handle large text inputs efficiently

### SVG Processing Best Practices
- Maintain vector quality throughout processing
- Implement efficient bounds detection
- Use proper SVG attribute management
- Handle SVG parsing errors gracefully

### Component Organization
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Create focused components for specific features
- Extract reusable functionality into separate components
- Maintain clear component hierarchies

## Future Considerations

### Planned Features
- Implementation of shine effect variations
- Additional letter style presets
- Enhanced export options
- Performance optimizations for large texts

### Performance Optimizations
- Continuous improvement of SVG processing
- Enhanced caching strategies
- Optimization of letter positioning algorithms
