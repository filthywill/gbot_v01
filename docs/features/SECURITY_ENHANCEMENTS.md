# Security Enhancements

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented in the Stizack application.

## Overview

Security has been significantly improved across the application to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure compliance with modern security standards.

## Authentication Security

### Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

Multi-factor authentication has been implemented to add an additional layer of security:

- SMS-based verification codes
- Email verification links
- Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
- Recovery codes for account access

### Password Policy Enforcement

The application now enforces stronger password requirements:

- Minimum length of 10 characters
- Must include uppercase and lowercase letters
- Must include at least one number
- Must include at least one special character
- Password history tracking to prevent reuse
- Password strength indicator

### Session Management

Enhanced session management features:

- Configurable session timeouts
- Automatic logout after inactivity
- Device tracking and management
- Session invalidation across devices
- IP address monitoring

## API Security

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting has been implemented to prevent abuse:

- IP-based rate limiting
- User-based rate limiting
- Graduated response (warnings, timeouts, blocks)
- Custom limits for sensitive endpoints

### Request Validation

Comprehensive request validation:

- Input sanitization for all user-supplied data
- Schema validation using Zod
- Content-type restrictions
- File upload scanning
- Deep object validation

### JWT Enhancement

Improvements to JWT implementation:

- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Refresh token rotation
- Token revocation capability
- Audience and issuer validation
- Payload encryption

## Data Protection

### Encryption

Enhanced encryption implementation:

- Data encryption at rest
- Transport layer security (TLS 1.3)
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive communications
- Secure key management
- Database field-level encryption

### Data Minimization

Principles of data minimization:

- Collection of only necessary data
- Automatic data purging after retention period
- Anonymization of analytics data
- Granular user consent for data collection

## Security Headers

Implementation of security headers:

- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

## CORS Configuration

Enhanced Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration:

- Restrictive origin policies
- Credential handling
- Pre-flight request handling
- Limited HTTP methods

## Vulnerability Management

Processes to manage vulnerabilities:

- Regular dependency scanning
- Automated security testing
- Vulnerability disclosure program
- Patch management process
- Security incident response plan

## Audit Logging

Comprehensive audit logging system:

- Authentication events
- Administrative actions
- Data access logs
- Error and exception logs
- Secure log storage
- Log integrity protection

## User Account Protection

Features to protect user accounts:

- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Suspicious activity detection
- Notification of security events
- Email verification for sensitive changes
- Password reset safeguards

## Implementation Details

### Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)

Row Level Security policies have been implemented in Supabase to enforce data access restrictions at the database level:

```sql
-- Example RLS policy for user_profiles table
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Content Security Policy

The Content Security Policy has been configured to prevent XSS attacks:

```typescript
// CSP middleware configuration
const cspMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader(
    'Content-Security-Policy',
    "default-src 'self'; " +
    "script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com; " +
    "style-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com; " +
    "img-src 'self' data: https://res.cloudinary.com; " +
    "font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; " +
    "connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co wss://*.supabase.co; " +
    "frame-ancestors 'none'; " +
    "base-uri 'self'; " +
    "form-action 'self'"
  );
  next();
};
```

### Authentication Flow Security

The authentication flow has been secured with additional validation steps:

```typescript
// Example of secure authentication flow with validation
const handleSignIn = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  try {
    // Validate input
    const validatedData = authSchema.parse({ email, password });
    
    // Rate limiting check
    if (await isRateLimited(email)) {
      throw new Error('Too many attempts. Please try again later.');
    }
    
    // Attempt authentication
    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
      email: validatedData.email,
      password: validatedData.password,
    });
    
    if (error) throw error;
    
    // Check if MFA is required
    if (data.user.factors && data.user.factors.length > 0) {
      return { requiresMFA: true, session: data.session };
    }
    
    // Log successful login
    await logAuthEvent({
      user_id: data.user.id,
      event_type: 'login',
      ip_address: getClientIp(),
      user_agent: getUserAgent(),
    });
    
    return { user: data.user, session: data.session };
  } catch (error) {
    // Secure error handling
    await logFailedAttempt(email);
    throw new Error('Authentication failed');
  }
};
```

## Security Testing

The following security testing methodologies are employed:

- Automated SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- Regular penetration testing
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code reviews focused on security

## Compliance

Security enhancements align with the following compliance frameworks:

- GDPR requirements
- CCPA requirements
- OWASP Top 10 mitigations
- Industry standard authentication requirements

## Next Steps

Planned security improvements:

1. Implementation of WebAuthn/FIDO2 for passwordless authentication
2. Enhanced anomaly detection for suspicious activities
3. Expanded security monitoring and alerting
4. Integration with threat intelligence services
5. Additional encryption options for user-generated content
