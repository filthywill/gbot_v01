Overlap Debug Panel - Workflow Guide

This guide explains how to update letter overlap rules in the application.

Step 1: Using the Overlap Debug Panel
----------------------------------
1. Open your application and locate the Overlap Debug panel in the bottom-right corner
2. Select a letter from the dropdown menu
3. Adjust values using the sliders or number inputs:
   - Min Overlap: Sets the minimum overlap value (0.01 to 0.5)
   - Max Overlap: Sets the maximum overlap value (0.01 to 0.5)
   - Special Case: Add specific overlap values for letter pairs
     a. Select a target letter from the dropdown
     b. Adjust the overlap value for that specific letter pair

Step 2: Generate and Update Lookup Table (Recommended)
----------------------------------------------------
1. Use the "Export Lookup Table" section in the debug panel
2. Click "Export" to generate all overlap combinations using runtime calculations
3. Wait for processing to complete (this calculates precise overlap values for all letter pairs)
4. Click "Update File" to automatically save the new lookup table
5. Refresh your application to use the updated values

Alternative: Manual Testing and Reset
----------------------------------
1. Make changes to individual letters for testing
2. Use "Reset" to restore a letter to its lookup table values
3. Modified letters are marked with a dot (â€¢) in the letter dropdown
4. Changes are temporary and stored in memory only

Additional Notes:
---------------
- The "Reset" button restores values from the lookup table (generatedOverlapLookup.ts)
- The Export workflow provides the most accurate overlap calculations
- Min Overlap cannot exceed Max Overlap (and vice versa)
- Special case values can be any value between 0.01 and 0.5
- Runtime calculation mode can be toggled for testing different calculation methods
