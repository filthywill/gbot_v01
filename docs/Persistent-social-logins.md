# Persistent Social Logins Implementation

## Issue Summary
When logging in with Google and switching between tabs, the authentication session was being lost and the user was logged out upon returning to the application tab, even with the "Remember me" preference enabled.

## Solution Components Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Session Storage Implementation ✅
- Modified the Supabase client's custom storage implementation to better handle social login sessions
- Default `rememberMe` to `true` for improved user experience
- Added detection for Google authentication sessions with special handling to preserve them regardless of the rememberMe setting
- Added detailed logging for session data analysis to help with debugging

### 2. Cross-Tab Communication Mechanism ✅ 
- Implemented a BroadcastChannel for cross-tab authentication synchronization
- Set up message passing between tabs to notify of authentication state changes
- Ensured proper error handling for browsers that don't support BroadcastChannel

### 3. Visibility Change Detection ✅
- Added event listeners for visibilitychange and focus events to detect when a user returns to the application tab
- Implemented auth state reinitialization when the page becomes visible again to ensure session persistence
- Added small delays to ensure browser state is fully restored before checking authentication

### 4. Session Recovery Enhancements ✅
- Improved error handling in the authentication initialization process
- Added retry mechanism for failed auth initialization
- Enhanced token refresh handling to better recover from failures

### 5. Configuration Improvements ✅
- Updated AUTH_CONFIG with settings specific to social login persistence
- Increased default session duration to 30 days
- Added `persistSocialLogins` flag to explicitly indicate intent to preserve social login sessions

## Testing Recommendations

When testing social login persistence:

1. Log in with Google and ensure "Remember me" is checked
2. Switch to a different browser tab and stay there for at least a minute
3. Return to the application tab - the app should maintain your logged-in state
4. If the app initially shows as logged out, it should automatically restore your session within a second or two
5. Refresh the page to ensure the session is properly persisted
6. Test in both development and production environments, as behavior can differ

## Troubleshooting

If sessions are still being lost:

1. Check browser console logs for any authentication errors
2. Verify that localStorage contains the session data
3. Look for any `visibilitychange` or `focus` event errors
4. Ensure that the BroadcastChannel implementation is working correctly
5. Check for any cross-origin issues that might affect session storage
